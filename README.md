# Computer-Vision
The project is based on the detection of objects, depending on
their color, by the computer via the webcam. When the user
approaches an object of a certain color in front of the computer's
webcam, the computer generates an up / down page move
response, depending on how the user moves the object.
Utilised technologies: python, OpenCV2, pyautogui
